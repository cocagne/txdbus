fd_client.py

Grabs '/path/to/FDObject' on 'org.example' bus and demonstrates calling
remote methods with UNIX open file descriptors as arguments (type 'h' as
per the dbus spec).

NOTE:
Passing open UNIX filedescriptors accross RPC / ICP mechanisms such as dbus
requires the underlying transport to be a UNIX domain socket.
